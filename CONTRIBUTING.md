# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few quick guidelines:

- Fork the repo and work on a feature branch.
- Keep commits focused and include tests for behaviour changes.
- Run `make lint` and `make typecheck` before opening a PR.
- CI will validate linting, type checks and run the test suite.

If your change adds or modifies public behaviour, update the README and add tests.
